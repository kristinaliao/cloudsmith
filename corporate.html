	<p>
		notice what you are being measured by.

		apply a hierarchy of importance accordingly. 

		for example, my friend, who works much longer hours than I do, who does a much better job of solving issues, taking follow-ups, and driving forward progress, is likely currently ranked lower than I am. she had a few weeks of carelessness in her laptop activity, she had a few days where she only logged 4ish hours. even though those 4 hours could have been fully productive, this caused a huge dent in her team lead's perception of her work. 
		
		if we model this using maslow's hierarchy of needs: laptop activity is at the bottom. it is most fundamental. actually doing a good job of managing her project is one or two levels above that in the hierarchy. 
		
		my project managing is acceptable at best - but I have fulfilled the lowest hierarchy of competence in the eyes of the organization. 

		I think the level above laptop activity might just be being nice. I have another friend who has fulfilled the laptop activity level of competence, and is so-so at the project managing, but is generally disliked by her managers.
