        only the present is real. the past and the future are illusions.

        'The messsenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever among you wakes up secure in his property, healthy in his body, and he has his food for the day, it is as if he were given the entire world." 
        Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhi 2346

As long as we are thinking only of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that ineterests him; and that all economics, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save in so far as they prolong and muultiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of spirit."

        the only way to do anything well and to enjoy it is to fully be present in the action of doing it. this is the only way to live life. the past and the future are illusions, only the present is real. naturally the conception of self, investigating the self, the viewing of the self as if an outsider, will fade away.<br>

        at every turn you are sold values that detract from what really matters. avoid playing games you cannot win.<br>

        hold beauty in reverence and create beautiful things. what is beautiful has had loving attention poured into it. true beauty is never in disharmony with its environment or the creator's values.<br>
        
        notice and gravitate towards vectors of ease. what feels natural, what feels like the body does not resist. <br>
